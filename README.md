## 🛡️ What Makes a Password Strong?
- At least 12–16 characters long
- You must have a unique password for each online account.
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols
- No personal data (name, DOB, phone numbers)
- A password shouldn’t contain any consecutive letters or numbers (i.e. ABCD, 1234, etc.)
- Use of passphrases adds memorability + security
- A password shouldn’t be the word “password” or the same letter or number repeated.
